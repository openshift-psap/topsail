# The instance type to use for the machineset being scaled
machineset_instance_type: ""

# scale is the total amount (across all machinesets of given instance type) of replicas to set.
#
# If the machinesets of the given instance type already have the required total number of replicas,
# their replica parameters will not be modified.
#
# Otherwise,
# - If there's only one machineset with the given instance type, its replicas will be set to the value of this parameter.
#
# - If there are other machinesets with non-zero replicas, the playbook will fail, unless the 'force_scale' parameter is
#   set to true. In that case, the number of replicas of the other machinesets will be zeroed before setting the replicas
#   of the first machineset to the value of this parameter.
